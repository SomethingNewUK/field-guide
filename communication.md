## Discourse

Our main method of communication is via [Discourse](https://discourse.somethingnew.org.uk/), which is basically an online forum. It's completely open to read, and you'll just need to sign up for an account to be able to join in the conversation.

## Trello

We use Trello to organise all the things we need to do. You can see all of our boards on the [team page](https://trello.com/somethingnewuk). Here is a rundown of the boards we have, and what they're used for;

* [Planning](https://trello.com/b/3dduLXeK/something-new-planning) - Overall strategic planning.
* [Comms & Campaigns](https://trello.com/b/WTeqp7Xk/comms-campaigns) - Organising our public communication strategy and any specific issue campaigns we run.
* [Technology](https://trello.com/b/BSUAl7Wv/technology) - We rely on technology a lot, and develop a lot of our own, so this board helps us organise all these things.
* [Lichfield May 2017](https://trello.com/b/n2ZwwfIc/lichfield-may-2017) - Used by Philip John to organise his election campaign for the County and Parish council elections in May 2017.
