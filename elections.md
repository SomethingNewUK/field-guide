Something New aims to stand as many candidates in as many elections as we can. You are invited to be one of those candidates. We ask only that you agree with our values. Nobody at Something New is expected to agree 100% with our manifesto, but if you're not enthused by most of it we might not be the party for you :) It's best if you are already a contributor to the manifesto, but not crucial.

We have guides for each type of election in the UK, to help you if you want to stand;

* European Parliament
* UK Parliament
* Scottish Parliament
* Welsh Assembly
* Northern Ireland Assembly
* [County Councils](eletions-ccounty-councils.html)
* Local (District/unitary/combined) Authorities
* Parish Councils
* Regional Mayors
* City Mayors
