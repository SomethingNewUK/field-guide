## Preparing

If you are interested in becoming a county councillor, you should do your best to be prepared, well before the election.

* [Find your ward](link).
* County Councils are responsible for state schools - find the schools in your ward.
* Transport is another responsibility of counties - what major transport infrastructure is in your ward, what is the state of highways?
* Counties also deal with fire and public safety. Are there emergency services based in your area? Have there been, or are there plans, cute to local emergency services?
* What are the council's plans for libraries?
* Your county council will have some sort of strategic plan - find it, read it, absorb it. It's the document that guides all the decisions of the council over a number of years.
* * Find the minutes of cabinet meetings, read some past one and make sure to follow and read future minutes.
* If you can, attend future cabinet meetings.
* Find the minutes of full council meetings, read some past ones and make sure to follow and read future minutes.
* If you can, attend future full council meetings.
* There will be a local plan for your area. Find it, read it, absorb it.
