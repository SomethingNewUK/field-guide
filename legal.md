Political parties are - for very good reason - subject to a bunch of laws and we're no different. This page has some important legal information about Something New that it's worth knowing or being able to refer to easily.

## Electoral Commission

We're registered with the [Electoral Commission](http://electoralcommission.org.uk) and you can see all the relevant details about [our registration on their website](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP2486).

## Financial Reporting
We are subject to pretty strict financial reporting rules. You should always ensure that any expenditure is approved by a party officer. We openly [report all our income and expenditure on GIthub](https://github.com/SomethingNewUK/finances).
